node version >= 10

before you run this program, make sure you run the beforeiaccept tool successfully (I put the README file into the beforeiaccept folder too)
1. npm run install (to install the required libraries)
2. node index.js ( to run the demo )

The results will be log to the output.json file when the program runs successfully
